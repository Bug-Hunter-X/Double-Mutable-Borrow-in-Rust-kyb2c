# Double Mutable Borrow in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create two mutable references to the same variable.  Rust's borrow checker prevents this to ensure memory safety. The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.

## Error Explanation

Rust's borrowing rules ensure that only one mutable reference or any number of immutable references can exist to a particular piece of data at any given time.  Attempting to violate this rule results in a compile-time error, preventing data races and other concurrency issues.

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the code to avoid the need for two mutable references simultaneously. This often involves using techniques like cloning, using immutable references where possible, or restructuring the data to avoid the conflict.
